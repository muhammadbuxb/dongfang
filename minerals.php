                                vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, deep purple, to rusty red.
                                The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4),
                                hematite, goethite, limonite or siderite. Hematite is also known as
                                "natural ore". The name refers to the early years of mining, when
                                certain hematite ores contained 66% iron and could be fed directly into
                                iron making blast furnaces.

                                90 and the fineness is above 330. Putty is a kind of substrate used for wall repair
                                and leveling, which lays a good foundation for the next decoration (brushing and
                                painting wallpaper). The putty is divided into two types: the inner wall and the
                                outer wall. The outer wall putty should resist the wind and the sun, so the glue is
                                large, the strength is high, and the environmental protection index is slightly
                                lower. The internal wall putty comprehensive index is good, healthy and
                                environmentally friendly, so the interior wall is not used externally, and the
                                external wall is not used internally. Usually the putty is gypsum or cement based,
                                so that the surface roughness is easier to bond firmly.</p>

                            <p><b>Slag (Heat Insulation Material) </b>Slag is used in industrial applications in

                                The use of slag in cement production Finely slag, honed, and added. Not
                                only increase the cement viscosity, but also add white ash, increase the strength
                                of building cement mortar, and extend the service life of the house.
                                When slag and white ash are used in the foundation smashing, adding slag,
                                not only reduces the amount of white ash, but receives the same amount of use
                                effect, becoming the most ideal waterproof material additive .
                                Slag and salt In order to prevent the slag from forming a lumpy, the
                                purpose of the Pengsong slag is that there is also a reason that the slag pressed
                                against the roof is exposed to solar radiation for a long time. After a period of
                                time, the cement pressed against it will be weathered and corroded, and the salt
                                will be released. The purpose of preservation .</p>
