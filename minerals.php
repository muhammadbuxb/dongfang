montmorillonite. The soil has good adhesion, expansibility, adsorption, 
plasticity, dispersity, lubricity, and cation exchange. After the exchange 
of other salt and lithium base, it has a very strong suspension, and 
after acidizing, it has excellent decolorization and so on. So it can be 
made into all kinds of adhesive, suspending agent, adsorbent, 
decoloring agent, plasticizer, catalyst, purifying agent, disinfectant,
thickening agents, detergent, filling agent, strengthening agent, etc. 
Its chemical composition is quite stable and is known as the "universal 
stone".

and leveling, which lays a good foundation for the next decoration (brushing and 
painting wallpaper). The putty is divided into two types: the inner wall and the 
outer wall. The outer wall putty should resist the wind and the sun, so the glue is 
large, the strength is high, and the environmental protection index is slightly 
lower. The internal wall putty comprehensive index is good, healthy and 
environmentally friendly, so the interior wall is not used externally, and the 
external wall is not used internally. Usually the putty is gypsum or cement based,

                            <p><b>Slag (Heat Insulation Material) </b>Slag is used in industrial applications in buildings.
 The use of slag in cement production Finely slag, honed, and added. Not 
only increase the cement viscosity, but also add white ash, increase the strength 
of building cement mortar, and extend the service life of the house.
 When slag and white ash are used in the foundation smashing, adding slag, 
not only reduces the amount of white ash, but receives the same amount of use 
effect, becoming the most ideal waterproof material additive .
 Slag and salt In order to prevent the slag from forming a lumpy, the 
purpose of the Pengsong slag is that there is also a reason that the slag pressed 
against the roof is exposed to solar radiation for a long time. After a period of 
time, the cement pressed against it will be weathered and corroded, and the salt 
will be released. The purpose of preservation .</p>
