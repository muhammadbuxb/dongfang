production,and the more common is the concrete expansion agent 
and the refractory material expansion agent. In the process of
hardening of concrete and amorphous refractory materials, it is often 
caused by the shrinkage of the raw material itself. The expansion agent 
is used to introduce quantitative volume expansion and compensate 
the shrinkage value of the material itself, preventing the material from 
contracting and cracking and affecting its structure, function and 
appearance. In recent years, with the extensive research and 
development of composite materials, the expansion materials have 
been widely applied to the production and manufacturing of materials.</p>
